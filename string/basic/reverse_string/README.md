# Reverse a String

This program reverses a given string.

## Algorithm
- Use slicing with step -1 (most efficient)
- Alternative methods: reversed() function, manual iteration, two-pointer approach
- Return new reversed string

## Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the length of the string

## Space Complexity
O(n) - New string is created
