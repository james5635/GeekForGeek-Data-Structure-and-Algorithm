# Concatenate Two Strings

This program concatenates (joins) two strings together.

## Algorithm
- Use + operator to concatenate strings
- Alternative methods: join() function, f-strings
- Return new combined string

## Time Complexity
O(n + m) where n and m are lengths of the strings

## Space Complexity
O(n + m) - New string is created
