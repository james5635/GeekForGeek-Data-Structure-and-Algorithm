# Find the Length of a String

Find the length of a given string without using built-in length functions.

## Problem Statement

Given a string, find its length by counting characters one by one.

## Approaches

- **Iterative**: Count characters one by one (O(n) time, O(1) space)
- **Enumerate**: Use enumerate to get last index + 1 (O(n) time, O(1) space)
