# Insert Character in String

This program inserts a character at a specific position in a string.

## Algorithm
- Use string slicing to split the string at the insertion point
- Concatenate the parts with the character in between
- Handle edge cases (position out of bounds)

## Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the length of the string

## Space Complexity
O(n) - New string is created
