# Remove Character at Position

This program removes a character from a given position in a string.

## Algorithm
- Use string slicing to exclude the character at the specified position
- Handle edge cases (position out of bounds)
- Return original string if position is invalid

## Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the length of the string

## Space Complexity
O(n) - New string is created
