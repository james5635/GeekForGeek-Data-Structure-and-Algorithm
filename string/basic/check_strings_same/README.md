# Check if Two Strings are Same

Check if two given strings are identical (equal).

## Problem Statement

Given two strings, determine if they contain the same characters in the same order.

## Approaches

- **Direct comparison**: Use == operator (O(n) time, O(1) space)
- **Manual comparison**: Compare character by character (O(n) time, O(1) space)
- **Zip comparison**: Use zip with all() (O(n) time, O(1) space)
