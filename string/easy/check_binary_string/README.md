# Check for Binary String

## Problem
Given a string, check if it is a binary string or not. A binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'.

## Approach
Iterate through each character in the string and verify if it is either '0' or '1'. If any character is different, return False.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the string
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
